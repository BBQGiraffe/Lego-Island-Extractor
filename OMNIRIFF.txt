RIFF based

"RIFF"      RIFF magic
4 bytes     RIFF size
"OMNI"      RIFF OMNI data

Most blocks are just a 4 byte type and a 4 byte size, except LIST blocks also
contain a subtype following the size.  Sizes are the entire size of the contents
of the block.  LIST blocks include the subtype as part of the size.

Node blocks which contain additional blocks:
LIST
    Subtypes:
    MxSt - Set of objects?
    MxDa - Data within a set of chunks?
MxSt - Set of chunks?

Leaf blocks which contain data:
MxHd - Some kind of header
MxOf - Some kind of list of offsets of interest in to the file?
MxOb - Description of a set of chunks? (object?)
    1 byte      type: 4 for audio, 7 for video, 3 for video header/frames
    6 bytes     padding?
    n bytes     null terminated string name of object
    4 bytes     track number?
    4 bytes     unknown, always 34 or 36?
    4 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     unknown, 0 if it's a video main MxOb
    4 bytes     some kind of multiple related to previous value?
    4 bytes     always 0
    2 bytes     unknown if frame, otherwise 0
    4 bytes     unknown if frame, otherwise 0
    4 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     unknown if frame, otherwise 0
    4 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     unknown if frame, otherwise 0
    20 bytes    always 0
    4 bytes     unknown, always 0x3FF0?
    12 bytes    always 0
    4 bytes     unknown, always 0x4FF0?
    8 bytes     always 0
    
    The main MxOb in an interleaved video track ends here ...

    n bytes     null terminated file name of object
    8 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     always 1?
    4 bytes     format?  " WAV", " FLC", " SMK"
    4 bytes     always 1?
    4 bytes     always 0?
    4 bytes     unknown, usually 79 but for one track it's 30

    ... and continues here.

    12 bytes    a LIST MxCh header
    4 bytes     always 2, maybe additional chunks?
    8 bytes     a MxOb header
    n bytes     a MxOb chunk for the video stream (type 3)
    8 bytes     a MxOb header
    n bytes     a MxOb chunk for the audio stream (type 4)

MxCh - Chunk of data
    2 bytes     usually 0, 16 if partial, last chunk is always 2
    4 bytes     the track number
    4 bytes     maybe a timestamp?
    4 bytes     chunk size but first partial chunk indicates the full size
                including additional partial chunks
    n bytes     data

    First chunks contain additional fields and no data:

    audio chunk:
        WAVE fmt header
        2 bytes     data type/encoding
        2 bytes     channels
        4 bytes     sample rate
        4 bytes     bytes per second
        2 bytes     bytes per sample*channels
        2 bytes     bits per sample

        4 bytes     total data size?
        4 bytes     unknown, always 44, RIFF header size?

    video chunk:
        FLC header
        4 bytes     total file size
        2 bytes     type
        2 bytes     number of frames
        2 bytes     width
        2 bytes     height
        2 bytes     depth
        2 bytes     flags
        2 bytes     delay
        2 bytes     reserved, always 0
        4 bytes     creation date
        4 bytes     creator serial
        4 bytes     update date
        4 bytes     updator serial
        2 bytes     x aspect
        2 bytes     y aspect
        14 bytes    extended stuff, unused here
        24 bytes    reserved, always 0
        4 bytes     offset to first frame
        4 bytes     offset to second frame
        40 bytes    reserved, always 0

    following frame chunks for " FLC" type contain these fields:
        4 bytes     always 1
        8 bytes     always 0
        4 bytes     always the video width
        4 bytes     always the video height

    audio chunk data contains PCM audio
    video chunk data contains a FLC chunk

pad  - Padding
