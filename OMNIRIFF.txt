Lego Island JUKEBOX.SI format

RIFF based

"RIFF"      RIFF magic
4 bytes     RIFF size
"OMNI"      RIFF OMNI data

Most blocks are just a 4 byte type and a 4 byte size, except LIST blocks also
contain a subtype following the size.  Sizes are the entire size of the contents
of the block.  LIST blocks include the subtype as part of the size.

Node blocks which contain additional blocks:
LIST
    Subtypes:
    MxSt - Set of objects?
    MxDa - Data within a set of chunks?
MxSt - Set of chunks?

Leaf blocks which contain data:
MxHd - Some kind of header
MxOf - Some kind of list of offsets of interest in to the file?
MxOb - Description of a set of chunks? (object?)
    1 byte      type: 4 for audio, 7 for video
    6 bytes     padding?
    n bytes     null terminated string name of object
    4 bytes     track number?
    4 bytes     unknown, always 34 or 36?
    4 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     unknown
    4 bytes     some kind of multiple related to previous value?
    46 bytes    always 0
    4 bytes     unknown, always 0x3FF0?
    12 bytes    always 0
    4 bytes     unknown, always 0x4FF0?
    8 bytes     always 0
    n bytes     null terminated file name of object
    8 bytes     always 0
    4 bytes     always 1?
    4 bytes     format?  always " WAV"
    4 bytes     always 1?
    4 bytes     always 0?
    4 bytes     unknown, usually 79 but for one track it's 30
MxCh - Chunk of data
    2 bytes     usually 0, sometimes 16, last chunk is always 2, some kind of
                type?
    4 bytes     the track number again?
    4 bytes     maybe a timestamp?
    4 bytes     chunk size but first partial chunk indicates the full size
                including subsequent partial chunks
    First chunk contains additional fields:
        WAVE fmt header:
        2 bytes     data type/encoding
        2 bytes     channels
        4 bytes     sample rate
        4 bytes     bytes per second
        2 bytes     bytes per sample*channels
        2 bytes     bits per sample

        4 bytes     total data size?
        4 bytes     unknown, always 44, RIFF header size?
pad  - Padding
